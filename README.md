## 📡 Real-Time IMU Sensor Data Streaming

This project streams real-time IMU sensor data using MQTT, Mosquitto, Flask, and WebSockets, providing a dynamic web dashboard for monitoring.

---

## 🧠 What is MQTT?

**MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)** is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for low-bandwidth, high-latency networks, making it ideal for IoT applications. It allows devices to publish messages to specific topics, which other clients can subscribe to for real-time updates.

## 🧱 What is Mosquitto?

**Mosquitto** is a widely-used open-source MQTT broker that facilitates message delivery between MQTT clients, such as sensors and servers, ensuring reliable communication.
